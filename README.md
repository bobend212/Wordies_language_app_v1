<h1 align="center"> Wordies - know every word as you want </h1> <br>

#### `General info`
> Word learning application. With this you can learn any word which you want. Only what you need to have is Excel where you will storing your words. The most advantage of the application is that words are show random which is a little difficult but give more efficient in remember the translation. Of course random generate words could be off. Every good answer remove word from the list but this option can be off too.
The application show progress when removing is on and show statistics when removing is off.

#### `Main goal`
> I created this application because i wanted learn any word which I wanted know and I didn't found anything what would suits me to do this. I wanted to make it very easy in use and intuitive. Now when I have a few new words to learn I adds them to column in Excel and translate 5-10 minutes per day. `This is awesome how easier and faster learn words can be!`

#### `Technologies`
> The application was created in Java, using Intellij IDEA. I used Maven to import libraries.
Beside of this I used:
* [Java Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/)
* [Apache POI 4.0](https://poi.apache.org/)

## `How start to learn?`
- Create your Excel file with words and translations. Column A contains words and column B has translation which you will typing

You have available two options:
 `Remove words` - if you turn on this and your answer will be correct the word is removed from the memory (not from the Excel file) then you will see your progress. If this option will be off, words stay in memory and will be repeated until you want. 
`Random words` - this option is on by default and showing you words in random order. When you turn off this then words will show you according you entered in Excel file from top to bottom.
 ###### `When it is off then starts 'difficult level'. Removing is on and next word shown you when you answered correctly on previous.`

- After answer correctly for each word (when random is on) we see congratulations window.

#### `Inspiration`
I made this application with YouTube tutorials help from many channels, too many to list their. But I want thanks all which contributed and gave me new and fresh ideas when I wrote this.
If I did have not go to school at weekends and go to work everyday, probably I could finished this app faster but it is how it is.
